# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction-Regression
Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance expenses for individuals based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and geographic region. Employing regression techniques, the model aims to provide accurate estimates of medical expenses, aiding individuals, insurance companies, and healthcare providers in better financial planning and risk assessment.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Thorough exploration of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and key variables influencing medical insurance expenses.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for regression analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creation of new features or transformations to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Selection: Implementation of regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. Comparison of their performances to choose the most suitable model.

Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of the chosen model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Utilization of cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning of model parameters to optimize performance and generalization.

Visualization: Clear and informative visualizations of predictions, model performance, and feature importance.

Deployment: Optionally, a simple deployment script or API for making predictions based on the trained regression model.
